# Responsive_home-page_companySite
My client asked me to create a personalized home page, requesting the site developed with responsive technology, simple and fast layout in browser loading.

I will try to implement everything in such a way that it is also optimized as much as possible at the SEO level, without neglecting the importance of the alt present in the code.

This home-page will also present in the future a button / link to connect to an external page, or a login page for internal company agents that will allow them to access a CRM (Customer relationship management) site, also a my other realization that you can find here, in my repositories.

It will allow the use of this product via mobile and desktop devices.
Site created in different programming languages, such as: Html, CSS, JS, SCSS.
